Here are descriptions of files in this folder:

input data:
categorydataset.csv
fulldataset.csv

Two files above go through AFM423_Data.rmd for data processing
The data processing also involved obtaining data from Yahoo finance which does take time. For your convenience, I have blocked the step and the data corresponding to it has been saved in 'price_nona.scv'

The output of AFM423_Data.rmd is TR_complete, which is the input data of 'AFM_423 Modelling(cleaned).rmd' (i.e. it's the cleaned dataset that is used to build the models.

And the 'Asset Return Prediction based on Decomposed ESG Factors.docx' is the report. 

Sorry for the inconvenience as there are indeed lots of files
